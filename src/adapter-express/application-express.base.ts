/**
 * Abstract class ApplicationBase.
 *
 * ApplicationBase serves as the foundational structure for building
 * server applications. It declares the lifecycle hooks that allow
 * subclasses to configure services, handle post-server initialization,
 * and perform cleanup when the server is shutting down. Extending
 * classes are required to provide implementations for these methods
 * to define specific behaviors for their particular use cases.
 *
 * @example
 * class Application extends ApplicationBase {
 *   protected configureServices() { //... }
 *   protected postServerInitialization() { //... }
 *   protected serverShutdown() { //... }
 * }
 *
 * @export
 * @abstract
